Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Report

Summary

In this project, the objective was to build and evaluate machine learning models for detecting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the approach, challenges encountered, and the results obtained:

Approach

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - The credit card dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure and features.
   - Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure data consistency.
   - Missing values were handled by imputing them with the median value of each respective column.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Categorical variables were one-hot encoded to convert them into a numerical format suitable for modeling.
   - Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to bring them to a common scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

3. Handling Class Imbalance:
   - Given the significant class imbalance between normal and fraudulent transactions, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed to generate synthetic samples of the minority class. This technique helps in improving model performance by balancing the class distribution.

4. Model Selection and Training:
   - Several classification models were chosen for training:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
     - LightGBM
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
   - Each model was trained using the preprocessed data.

5. Evaluation:
   - Model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
     - Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
     - Precision-Recall AUC: Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Precision-Recall curve, which shows trade-offs between precision and recall.
     - ROC AUC: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC score, which indicates the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
     - Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
     - Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

6. Visualization:
   - Precision-Recall curves were plotted for each model to visually assess their performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

 Challenges

- Computational Resources: Training SVM and Neural Network models was computationally intensive due to the dataset's size and complexity.
  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters for each model to achieve optimal performance required careful experimentation and tuning.
