 Time Series Forecasting for Inventory and Sales Prediction: A Concise Report

 Introduction

In this project, we aimed to develop robust time series forecasting models for inventory management and sales prediction. Accurate forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management, cost savings, and better decision-making in businesses. We explored both classical and machine learning approaches to build and evaluate these models.

 Approach

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - We started by loading multiple CSV files, including `train.csv`, `transactions.csv`, `holidays_events.csv`, `oil.csv`, and `stores.csv`.
   - Merging these datasets allowed us to enrich the training data with additional features like transactions, oil prices, and holiday events.
   - Missing values were handled using forward fill, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
   - Date features were extracted to add more depth to the model.

2. Classical Time Series Methods:
   - We implemented the ARIMA and SARIMA models to capture the temporal patterns in the sales data.
   - ARIMA was used to model non-seasonal data, while SARIMA accounted for seasonality.

3. Machine Learning Approaches:
   - Prophet: Developed by Facebook, Prophet is well-suited for daily data with seasonal effects. It handled our sales data effectively and provided clear visualizations of trends and forecasts.
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks: Using Keras and TensorFlow, we built an LSTM model to capture long-term dependencies in the sales data. This involved normalizing the data, creating sequences, and building a neural network with LSTM layers.

 Challenges

1. Data Integration: Merging multiple datasets with different structures and handling missing values was challenging. Ensuring data consistency and correctness required careful preprocessing.
2. Model Selection: Deciding the best parameters for ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models involved extensive experimentation and cross-validation.
3. Computational Resources: Training LSTM models required significant computational power and time, especially with large datasets.

 Results

- ARIMA and SARIMA: These models provided a good baseline with decent accuracy. However, they struggled with capturing complex patterns and seasonality as effectively as the machine learning models.
- Prophet: Prophet performed well, especially in handling holidays and providing clear trend visualizations. It was user-friendly and required minimal tuning.
- LSTM: The LSTM model captured long-term dependencies and provided accurate forecasts. However, it required careful tuning and substantial computational resources.

 Conclusion

Combining classical methods and machine learning approaches allowed us to create robust forecasting models. While ARIMA and SARIMA provided a solid foundation, Prophet and LSTM offered superior performance in capturing complex patterns. This hybrid approach ensures better accuracy and reliability in sales and inventory forecasting, leading to informed decision-making and cost efficiency.

By leveraging these models, businesses can enhance their inventory management processes and predict sales trends more accurately, ultimately driving better business outcomes.
